##### *Why "auspicious" you say? Well, these dots signify the start and end of something for me!* 
*Choosing the colors took the most time, initially I started with [BlackLotus Colorscheme](https://github.com/PoisonIsBestType/BlackLotus/tree/main), which was very attractive, but didn't had much colors, then I tried [Srcery Colorscheme](https://github.com/srcery-colors/srcery-vim) then I stumbled upon an art on DeviantArt and that became the basis for colors, I handpicked the colors from it (oh how tiring it was!) but then they were trashy too, so I then used AI Color Scheme Generators, which gave me some colors to build upon further and then finally some ChatGPT did it nicely!*

If you've read this, thank you, I hope you'll use the colors nicely, it took me 3 days to collect them! And ofc don't forget to star if you liked this! 

Thank you!

## Some Notes For Setting This Up:
1. I have modified [these rofi configs](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) , but as they were interlinked, many files from this original repo are still present. So to launch my modified rofi stuff execute these scripts:  
  - WiFi Menu: rofi/rofi-wifi-menu.sh
  - Menu: rofi/launchers/type-7/launcher.sh
  - PowerMenu: rofi/applets/bin/powermenu.sh
2. Now, to modify these scripts and their behavior, modify these files:
	 - WiFi Menu: rofi/ultimate.rasi
	 - Menu: rofi/launchers/type-7/style-8.rasi
	 - Powermenu: rofi/applets/type-4/style-3.rasi
